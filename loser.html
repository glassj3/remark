          And it doesn’t make you a loser.
          I was called a loser this week. By a tech bro who was pissed that I decided not to be a co-founder in his startup because I didn’t have the emotional capital for it.
          I’ve known him for a long time. And his response to my honesty was to lash out.

                      Anxiety has a way of drawing you in and making you engage with every anxious thought that comes in thinking distance of you. It’s exhausting! Experiment with standing back and watching your thoughts as an observer, knowing that when they are ready, they will pass. Sometimes we need to engage with thoughts and feelings,

                    <p class="page">
                     and sometimes we need to stand back and wait for them move on. Try imagining your thoughts and feelings as a bubble, and then watch them float by.
                     Experiment with letting them be, without needing to change them, understand them, or talk yourself out of them.
