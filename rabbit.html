                      Will there ever be a day in the future for which will afford me the opportunity to get off this emotional roller coaster I call my life? I am not referring to me no longer living. I am, more or less, referring to the reaching of a level of self-growth that will no longer need fits of depression as a way of evolving into a better version of myself.

                    I have dealt with manic depression in one form or another for most of my life.

                      Some fits of depression last only half-a-day while others have lasted for weeks and even months. The initial feeling of having no control over myself turned out to be the only thing I could actually control. I allow myself to fall victim to the paradox of attempting to control external factors while disallowing myself to control my internal factors; that being my thoughts, my actions, and my mindset.

In a day that I feel so very alone, I find masochistic comfort in the depression which is beginning to hold me close once more.
