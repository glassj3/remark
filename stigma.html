             People believe it's a joke, like it's nonexistent. Mental Illness, it's real, it's covered, it's an issue, it's hidden, but we need to do something about it. We must end the stigma attached with mental illness.

Mental Illness is certainly not a character flaw and society should be open to people who suffer from psychological disorders. No one realizes how stigma leads to isolation, quietness, silence, and even suicide. Stigma must change, must end. Society as a whole as the power to end it.

                      People need to recognize that mental illness is just not a phase, it's real, and it's something that must be addressed.
