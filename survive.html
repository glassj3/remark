                      Just recently I had another bad anxiety attack. I was lightheaded and my heart rate was up. Not wanting to be at home, the place where this was coming from, I left the house in search of place in the middle of nature. Not too shortly after arriving in such a place, I had decided to go for a short drive before heading home. But the thought of going home had gotten me so worked up I decided to go into work and see some of the people there.

                      The moment I sat down, my heart was racing so fast I couldn’t keep up and my hands were so shaky. When looked up into the eyes of someone who is so kind hearted and a good friend of mine, I could have cried. His eyes showed an emotion that I had not seen for many, many years. He was so worried that he grabbed my hand to get my attention.

                      I soon realized that I needed help, and I was willing to fight for it. The first discussion I had about my anxiety was with my mother. She refused and argued that counseling was just a waste of time and money. Being the dedicated Christian woman she is, she suggested reading the bible.
